[00:00.000]Carly Rae Jepsen - I Really Like You
[00:06.610]I really wanna stop
[00:08.470]But I just gotta taste for it
[00:10.660]I feel like I could fly with the ball on the moon
[00:14.540]So honey hold my hand you like making me wait for it
[00:18.500]I feel I could die walking up to the room, oh yeah
[00:23.560]Late night watching television
[00:27.370]But how we get in this position?
[00:31.300]It's way too soon, I know this isn't love
[00:37.450]But I need to tell you something

[01:03.270]I really really really really really really like you
[01:07.710]And I want you, do you want me, do you want me, too?
[01:11.540]It's like everything you say is a sweet revelation
[01:15.810]All I wanna do is get into your head
[01:19.490]Yeah we could stay alone, you and me, and this temptation
[01:23.580]Sipping on your lips, hanging on by thread, baby
[01:28.490]Late night watching television
[01:32.260]But how we get in this position?
